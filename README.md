# DatabaseManagement

## Course Project
This project is done as a part of the CSCI X370 (Database management) Course at UGA under the guidance of Dr.Miller. 

More information on the project and the base java codes can be found in Dr.Millers [website](http://cobweb.cs.uga.edu/~jam/home/courses/csci4370/s4370.html)

All of the java files are part of the cource , reuse or copy of the same for the X470 course at UGA is Prohibited.

## Project 1:
Finish the implementation the 5 RA Operators that are partially implemented in Table.java. Store tuples in an ArrayList. Use MapType.NO_MAP for the index type (no indexing).
#### Java files: 
- ArrayUtil
- Table
- KeyType
- MovieDB(main)

## Project 2:
Implement over Project 1.
Use indices (TreeMap (in Java), LinHashMap and BpTreeMap) to speed up the processing of Select and Join. Indices must be integrated and used in the Table class. For a bonus of up to (+10) provide the option of storing the tuples in a FileList as well as in an ArrayList.
