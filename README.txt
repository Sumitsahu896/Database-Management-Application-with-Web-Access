JoinTest:

Created 5 tables for the join case, I'm not aware of the join function so I did ( final time - initial time)
to get the time and converted in the sec.

BpTreeTest:
Made tables


SelectLinHashMap:
Made tables


SelectTest: It's a whle lot of mess!!

Generates Random data for all the tables, made select functions for 1 key, 2 attributes and 3 attributes,
Then printed it!

SelectTreeMap: 
Made tables


--------------------------------------------THINGS LEFT-------------------------------------------------------------

Student_1000 = new Table("Student", "id name address status", "Integer String String String", "id", "BpTreeMap");
The "BpTreeMap" part is not working as we need to convert that part to Comparable[] type for all the functions.


Wee have to save the Randome data generated on a file AT RUNTIME and then use it for all the functions.
(I'm not sure of it, if we can use all that data internally without saving it in a file, then that counts too.)


We have to make A TIME GRAPH for all the functions.
